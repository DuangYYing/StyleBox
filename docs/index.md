# Style Box

The Style Box is a platform that integrates the idea of e-commerce and social network. It has three sections: ‘design for you’, ‘design for others’ and ‘favorite ootd sharing’. The Style Box lets the customer get customized clothing shopping experience, gives stylists opportunities to show their talents and maintains an active fashion community. Our platform provides one-stop service, including outfit fixing, shopping, and delivery. The customer can pick up a stylist on our website to help them select clothing items and design the outfits. The customer will get a style report and buy all the clothing items on our website. Eventually, a style box would be delivered to the customer containing all they need to become a fashion insider.
