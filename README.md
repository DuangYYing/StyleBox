# Style Box 

The Style Box is a platform that integrates the idea of e-commerce and social network. It has three sections: ‘design for you’, ‘design for others’ and ‘favorite ootd sharing’. The Style Box lets the customer get customized clothing shopping experience, gives stylists opportunities to show their talents and maintains an active fashion community. Our platform provides one-stop service, including outfit fixing, shopping, and delivery. The customer can pick up a stylist on our website to help them select clothing items and design the outfits. The customer will get a style report and buy all the clothing items on our website. Eventually, a style box would be delivered to the customer containing all they need to become a fashion insider.

## Installing / Getting started

1. Clone the project to your local computer

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cs421sp22-homework/project-team-07-blackbox.git
   ```
2. Install frontend dependency

   ```shell
   cd project-team-07-blackbox\code\frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Open backend code project from IntelliJ IDEA and run file 'project-team-07-blackbox/code/backend/src/main/java/com/stylebox/StyleBoxBackendApplication.java', make sure your Java version is 11 and install Maven.

4. Run frontend with the following command. The frontent webpage is run on http://localhost:3000 in default.

   ```shell
   cd project-team-07-blackbox\code\frontend
   npm start
   ```

   

## Developing

1. Install IntelliJ IDEA

   We use IntelliJ IDEA as our development IDE. It can be downloaded here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.

2. Install React

   We are using React to develop the front end. To install React, you need to install Node.js first. Node.js can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

   Then, use the following commands to set up the development environment.

   ```
   npm install -g create-react-app
   cd project-team-07-blackbox\code\frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Download Heroku CLI

   Our web app is deployed on Heroku, installing Heroku CLI allows developers to manage Heroku apps directly from the terminal. Heroku can be installed with npm with following command. You can also refer to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli for more installing options.

   ```
   npm install -g heroku
   ```





Detailed and step-by-step documentation for setting up local development. For example, a new team member will use these instructions to start developing the project further. 

```shell
commands here
```

You should include what is needed (e.g. all of the configurations) to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools (include download links), explaining what database (and version) has been used, etc. If there is any virtual environment, local server, ..., explain here. 

Additionally, describe and show how to run the tests, explain your code style and show how to check it.

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here. Moreover, give instructions on how to build and release a new version. In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, it must be stated here.
